# 🧠 Technical Decisions and Considerations

This document outlines key decisions, constraints, and challenges encountered during the design and implementation of the automated test suite for **InOrder**.

---

## ✅ What Was Automated and Why

The test strategy prioritized the **Order Management** module due to its high business impact and complexity. Covered features include:

- Order creation and renaming
- Saving/discarding/restoring orders
- Adding products from various sources (search, categories, starred, saved lists, order history)
- Status history
- Checkout flow and required field validation

These features were automated because they:

- Are core to business workflows
- Involve frequent user interaction and logic branches
- Are time-consuming to validate manually

> 📝 Note: While order status changes (e.g., Draft → To Manager → To Finance → Placed) are expected, **the automation does not yet verify the status transitions via UI.** That may be delegated to backend validations or future tests.

Additionally, basic flows for authentication (login, logout, password recovery) are included. Utility helpers (`auth.ts`, `order-helpers.ts`) were developed to promote DRY principles.

## ⚠️ Challenges and Technical Constraints

### 1. Fragile Selectors

The frontend lacks stable `data-testid` or `id` attributes. Selectors are based on:

- CSS classes (`.cursor-pointer`, `.mud-typography`)
- Text content (via `getByText` / `getByRole`)
- Relative DOM position (`nth-child`, etc.)

This means that if the UI design or wording changes, the selectors may break.

**✅ Mitigation:**
- Centralize all selectors into helpers for maintainability.
- Request `data-testid` attributes from the frontend team where feasible.

### 2. Language-Sensitive Validation Messages

Validation messages shown during checkout vary by language. For example:

**Spanish:**
- `Se requiere dirección de envío.`
- `Se requiere fecha de entrega.`

**English:**
- `Shipping address is required.`
- `Delivery date is required.`

**❗ Issue:**
If the environment language changes (e.g., to Dutch), tests fail when expecting specific text.

**✅ Recommended Approach:**

- Lock test environments to a consistent language (`es`, `en`, etc.).
- Centralize messages in a dictionary for dynamic lookup:
